newznab plus scripts for ubuntu 12.04

These scripts assume you have used the following 2 guides
 1) http://www.tiag.me/how-to-backfill-newznab-safely-without-bloating-your-database/
 2) https://sites.google.com/site/1204nnplus/optional-configurations
You can still use these scripts without having followed those guides but will have to edit to suit your application.
PLEASE NOTE: I used newznab_screen_backfill.sh instead of newznab_screen_local.sh You may need to change this!!!
Be sure to adjust paths to your install DIR
If you are not using Sphinx, Comment out the "Shpinx Startup" section
If you do not want to see Top, NIC stats, or Drive stats then comment out the "Monitoring Windows" section
